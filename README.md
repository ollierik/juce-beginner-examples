# Beginner examples for JUCE

This repository contains simple examples for JUCE (version 6) for beginners. I've written these as part of teaching at a university level. The examples are mostly aimed at students with little experience in JUCE or C++.

### Disclaimer:
Some of the practices used in these examples do not represent the way thing should probably be done in actual production level code.

## Get started:

You need Xcode (Mac) or Visual Studio (Win) installed.

Download JUCE 6:

Run the Projucer, and set the Global Paths from the top main menu to point to where you extracted JUCE. All of the examples have been configured to use Global Paths.
