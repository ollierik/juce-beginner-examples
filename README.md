# Beginner examples for JUCE

This repository contains simple examples for JUCE (version 6) for beginners. I've adapted these from the examples I've written for university level studies. The examples are mostly aimed at students with little experience in JUCE and/or C++.

### Disclaimer:
Some of the practices used in these examples do not represent the way thing should probably be done in actual production level code, but should be easier to understand for beginners. In other words, performance and const-correctness have been sacrificed for readability.

## Getting started:

You need Xcode (Mac) or Visual Studio (Win) installed.

Download JUCE 6:
https://juce.com/get-juce

Run the Projucer, and set the Global Paths from the top main menu to point to where you extracted JUCE. All of the examples have been configured to use Global Paths.

Clone the repository, open a .jucer file from one of the examples, and export.
